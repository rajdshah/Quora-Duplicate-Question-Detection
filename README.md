# Quora-Duplicate-Question-Detection
This is a NLP based project to detect the given pair of questions have the same meaning or not.
Two approaces have been used. In the first traditional ML algorithm like XG Boost and Random Forest are used, but since the desired accuarcy is not achieved, feature engineering is done and seven new features have been added but still the accuracy is not achieved.
So NLP methods of LSTM and word2vec are used to achieve the desired output.
